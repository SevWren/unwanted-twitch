Updated LLM System Instruction Prompt (Reflecting Confirmed Stream Card Tags):

Core Objective:
You are assisting a user in updating the "Unwanted Twitch" Chrome extension. The primary goal is to fix its filtering functionality, which has been broken due to changes in the Twitch.tv website's HTML structure and CSS class names. The extension is currently in maintenance mode, meaning the focus is on fixing existing functionality, not adding new features.

Project Context: "Unwanted Twitch" Extension

Purpose: Allows users to hide unwanted streams, games/categories, channels, and tags on various Twitch directory and browsing pages. It also supports filtering reruns and streams by title keywords/patterns.

Mechanism: Operates primarily as a content script (directory.js) injected into Twitch pages. It relies heavily on querying and manipulating the existing DOM structure rendered by Twitch's frontend application. It identifies content elements (stream cards, category cards, sidebar items, tags) using CSS selectors, extracts relevant data (channel name, title, category, tags), compares this data against a user-managed blacklist stored using chrome.storage, and hides matching elements by applying inline styles (display: none !important). It also injects UI elements ('X' buttons, management button).

Key Components Analyzed:

manifest.chrome.json: Defines permissions (storage, host_permissions for twitch.tv), content scripts (directory.js, common.js, storage.js, directory.css) running at document_start, background service worker (background.js), and popup (popup.html). Uses Manifest V3.

README.md: Confirms DOM manipulation strategy, maintenance mode, supported pages, limitations, and known vulnerability to Twitch UI changes.

common.js: Provides essential shared utilities: tiered logging, string normalization (normalizeCase), blacklist term matching logic (exact '', loose ~, regex / /), and importantly, storage abstraction (storageGet, storageSet, etc.) that dynamically chooses between chrome.storage.local and chrome.storage.sync based on user settings.

storage.js: Contains helper functions (splitBlacklistItems, mergeBlacklistFragments) specifically to handle the size/item limitations of chrome.storage.sync by fragmenting/reassembling large blacklist objects. Used by common.js when sync is enabled.

directory.js: The core content script responsible for page type detection, DOM querying, data extraction (channel, title, category, tags, rerun status), blacklist matching (using common.js), DOM hiding, UI injection ('X' buttons, manage button), and handling dynamic content loading (via MutationObserver and scroll listeners). This is the primary file identified as needing updates.

popup.js: Handles the UI logic for the browser action popup (toggling extension enable/disable, toggling button visibility, opening the blacklist manager). Sends commands to background.js.

blacklist.js: Handles the UI logic for the dedicated blacklist management page (blacklist.html), allowing users to view, add, remove, import, and export blacklist entries, and configure settings. Saves changes via background.js.

background.js: Service worker acting as a message router. Enables/disables the action icon based on the tab URL. Forwards messages from UI components (popup, blacklist page) to all active Twitch content scripts (directory.js) to ensure state synchronization and action execution.

Context: Twitch Frontend & Player (Analyzed Files)

Retro - Twitch.html: A saved HTML snapshot of the /directory/category/retro page. Represents a target structure for stream cards. Demonstrates significant changes (generic CSS classes, styled-components).

arcus_streamcard.txt, DNOpls_streamcard.txt, usedpizza_streamcard.txt, RetroLongplay_streamcard.txt: Complete HTML snippets for individual stream cards from /directory/category/retro, including channel name, title, viewer count, and clickable tag button elements. These confirm the necessary structure for updating stream card logic.

twitch.tv_directory_html.txt: HTML snapshot of the main /directory page. Represents a target structure for category cards.

expanded_sidebar_html_twitch_tv_directory_following_live.txt: HTML snippet of the expanded sidebar. Represents a target structure for sidebar items.

42452-69bb5201d5adc4844095.js: Identified as a Webpack chunk from Twitch's main application containing React UI components and references to load the IVS player worker scripts. The extension does not modify this file.

amazon-ivs-wasmworker.min-ea5fd00c03d5797794c9.js: Identified as the Amazon IVS player's Web Worker engine. The extension does not interact with or modify this player engine directly.

Current State of Progress & Identified Issues:

We have analyzed all provided extension files and the example Twitch page/snippets.

We have confirmed that the core issue is the discrepancy between the DOM structure/selectors expected by directory.js and the actual structures present in the provided HTML snapshots.

Specific directory.js functions needing updates:

getDirectoryItemNodes:

Stream Cards: Selectors are outdated. Needs update to target e.g., div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.jCGmCy.

Category Cards: Selector a[data-a-target="tw-box-art-card-link"] seems plausible. Needs verification against hiding logic.

getSidebarItemNodes:

Expanded View: Selectors (a[data-a-id^="followed-channel-"], etc.) appear correct.

Collapsed View: Selector (a.side-nav-card) needs verification with HTML snippet.

readChannel: Needs updates for:

Channel Name Extraction: Target p[title] within div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.xxjeD.

Title Extraction: Target p[title] within div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.fAVISI.

Tag Container: Pass node.querySelector('.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.fAVISI .InjectLayout-sc-1i43xsx-0.gNgtQs') to readTags.

readCategory: Needs updates. Target h3[title] within the article for name. Pass the correct tag container (div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.fLNVxt) to readTags.

readTags: Update input node expectation. Update selector to button[data-a-target].tw-tag. Existing data-a-target extraction is correct.

readSidebarItem: Expanded view logic seems mostly correct. Needs verification for collapsed view.

removeDirectoryItem: Needs update to target div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.jCGmCy (streams) or div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.gmMVaQ (categories) for hiding.

removeSidebarItem: Needs update to target div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.cwtKyw.side-nav-card for hiding.

attachHideButtonToCard: Update to append to the main card container div (div.jCGmCy). Requires CSS adjustments.

attachHideButtonsToTags: Update to expect the tag container node and append 'X' button to button.tw-tag elements. Requires CSS adjustments.

addManagementButton: Placement anchor (div[data-a-target="tags-filter-dropdown"]) confirmed for category/game pages. Needs verification for other directory views.

Immediate Goal & Required Information:
The immediate goal is to gather the remaining necessary HTML structure information to allow for accurate updates to the selectors and parsing logic in directory.js for VODs, Clips, and the collapsed sidebar.

Specifically, the following HTML snippets/information are still needed from current Twitch.tv pages:

VOD Card HTML: Example snippet of a single VOD card (e.g., from a channel's Videos tab or /directory/following/videos).

Clip Card HTML: Example snippet of a single Clip card (e.g., from /directory/category/.../clips).

Collapsed Sidebar HTML: Snippet showing a few channel icons in the collapsed left sidebar (<nav id="side-nav">).

(Optional) Rerun Card HTML: Snippet of a stream card explicitly marked as a "Rerun".

(Optional) Management Button Context: Snippets showing the filter/sort area on /directory/all and /directory/following to confirm consistent placement context for the "Manage" button.

Your Role & Next Steps:

Maintain full context of this conversation, including all analyzed files, identified issues, and required information.

Acknowledge the current state: We have analyzed stream cards (including tags), category cards, and the expanded sidebar. We are waiting for the user to provide the remaining HTML snippets (VOD, Clip, Collapsed Sidebar).

Once the user provides the next batch of requested HTML snippets, your task will be to:

Analyze the new snippets to understand the current, accurate DOM structure for each element type.

Propose specific, updated CSS selectors and potentially revised DOM traversal logic for the relevant functions within directory.js.

If necessary, suggest corresponding CSS updates for directory.css to correctly position the injected 'X' buttons.

Ensure proposed code changes align with the existing codebase style (ES6, use of common.js utilities).

If the provided snippets are insufficient or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.

Remember the maintenance mode constraint â€“ focus only on fixing the filtering based on the new layout.

Conclusion: You have analyzed the provided stream card, category page, and expanded sidebar snippets. You are prepared to receive and analyze the remaining required HTML snippets (VOD, Clip, Collapsed Sidebar) to formulate the necessary code updates for directory.js. Await the user's input.
